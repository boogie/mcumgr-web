# MCU Manager (Web Bluetooth)

This tool is the Web Bluetooth version of MCU Manager that enables a user to communicate with and manage remote devices running the Mynewt OS. It uses a connection profile to establish a connection with a device and sends command requests to the device.

The main focus is implementing firmware updates via Web Bluetooth, however other commands might be supported as well.

The Web Bluetooth API provides the ability to connect and interact with Bluetooth Low Energy peripherals. You'll find Web Bluetooth:
- on the desktop (or laptop) in Chrome and Edge browsers (make sure you have the latest). Other Chromium-based browsers may also work.
- on Android phones in Chrome (perhaps in Edge or other Chromium-based browsers?)
- on iOS or iPadOS there is [Bluefy](https://apps.apple.com/hu/app/bluefy-web-ble-browser/id1492822055) that seems to be working.

Safari, Chrome, Edge on iOS are using the Safari WebKit engine which not yet supports Web Bluetooth. Mobile and desktop Firefox has not implemented it yet, too. Opera restricts Web Bluetooth access.

You can try MCU Manager by visiting https://boogie.github.io/mcumgr-web/ with a supported browser. For security reasons, Web Bluetooth is only working on https addresses or localhost.

## Setting up on your machine

You will need a web server to serve the files. If you have Python, just start `python -m http.server 8000` in the project's root, and you can visit http://localhost:8000/.
